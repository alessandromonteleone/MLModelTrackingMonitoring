# Introduction to microservices

Microservices architecture is an approach to designing software systems where a large application is composed of small, independent services that communicate with each other via well-defined APIs.
Unlike traditional monolithic architectures, where all components are tightly coupled, microservices allow each service to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

## Monolitich Architecture VS Microservices Architecture

### What is a monolithic architecture?

A monolithic architecture is a traditional model of a software program, compiled as a unified unit that is self-contained and independent of other applications. The word “monolith” evokes something large and unchanging, which reflects well the nature of this architecture in software. In a monolithic architecture, all business functions are grouped into a single code base. To make a change, the entire stack must be updated, compiled and deployed again, a process that can be complex and time-consuming.

Monoliths offer advantages such as simplified code management and smooth deployment, making them particularly suitable in the early stages of a project because they allow all components to be released in a single operation.

### Advantages of monolithic architecture.

Organizations can benefit from a monolithic architecture in certain situations. The main advantage is speed of development due to the simplicity derived from using a unified code base.

The main advantages include:

- **Easy deployment**: a single executable file or directory greatly simplifies deployment.
- **Development**: applications with a centralized code base are easier to develop.
- **Performance**: a monolithic API can often perform functions that would require multiple APIs in a microservice architecture.
- **Simplified testing**: monolithic applications, being single units, make it easier to perform end-to-end testing.
- **Easy debugging**: having all code in one location makes it easier to track requests and troubleshoot problems.

### Disadvantages of monolithic architecture.

Despite their initial effectiveness, monolithic applications can become difficult to manage as they grow in complexity.

Major disadvantages include:

- **Reduced development speed**: development of large monoliths is slower and more complex.
- **Limited scalability**: individual components cannot be scaled separately.
- **Reliability**: an error in a single module can compromise the entire application.
- **Limited technology adoption**: changes to frameworks or languages affect the whole system.
- **Lack of flexibility**: the entire application is constrained to the technologies initially adopted.
- **Slow deployment**: even a small change requires recompilation and redeployment of the monolith.

### What are microservices?

Microservice architecture is an approach that decomposes an application into a series of autonomous services, each with its own specific purpose. These services can be updated, tested, deployed and scaled independently. Microservices separate business functionality into multiple independent code bases, making complexity more manageable.

This architecture is critical for implementing practices such as continuous delivery, enabling teams to respond quickly to user needs. This is why the adoption of microservices is closely linked to the DevOps approach.

### Advantages of microservices.

Microservices do not solve all problems, but they address several critical issues in growing applications. Because each service runs independently, updates and maintenance can be performed more frequently and reliably.

Key benefits include:

- **Agility**: they encourage Agile development, enabling frequent deployments by small teams.
- **Flexible scalability**: you can scale only the services you need, improving performance without affecting the entire application.
- **Continuous deployment**: release cycles are more frequent and faster, moving from weekly updates to daily releases.
- **More reliability**: errors can be isolated and corrected without affecting the entire system.
- **Independent deployment**: each microservice can be deployed individually.
- **Technological flexibility**: each team can choose the tools and technologies they prefer.
- **More satisfied teams**: teams enjoy more autonomy and can act faster.

### Disadvantages of microservices.

Although microservices offer many advantages, they can also introduce new complexities.

The main disadvantages include:

- **Extension of development**: with more services and teams involved, development can become more complex and slow down.
- **Infrastructure costs**: each new service incurs additional infrastructure, testing and monitoring costs.
- **Organizational overhead**: coordination between teams becomes more complex.
- **Complicated debugging**: because each microservice has separate logs, troubleshooting becomes more difficult.
- **Lack of standardization**: without a common platform, different language and monitoring standards may emerge.
- **Complicated ownership management**: it becomes difficult to know who is responsible for which services and who to contact in case of problems.
